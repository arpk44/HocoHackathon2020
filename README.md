## Inspiration

Our theme was about how we can help our community. I wanted to create a website that would help everyone get **STRAIGHT** and **CORRECT** facts about the pandemic.

## What it does

It helps them find nearby COVID-19 testing places, HoCo Meal locations, up-to-date news, facts about the pandemic & cases.

## How I built it

I used Sublime Text editor, I used the first HTML, then added some CSS to make it look good. Later, I added some JavaScript and touches of other languages to make it fun and interactive.

## Challenges I ran into

Some challenges were that I didn't much time, I had to use tools like a location sensor which takes a lot of time, and I had to create a working navbar. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

For making this navbar work, working on this and participating in the contest.

## What I learned

I learned that I shouldn't underestimate myself If I put my mind and set a goal, I can complete it.

## What's next for Coronavirus Help

Next, I have decided to add free chatting for questions and the computer can find all the testing locations over the country, just using the Zipcode of the area.
